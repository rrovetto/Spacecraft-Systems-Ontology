# The Spacecraft Systems Ontology

The Spacecraft Systems Ontology is an ontology of spacecraft, their subsystems, and other component parts. As part of a [broader suite of spaceflight ontologies](https://purl.org/space-ontology), it aims to present a reusable standard terminology and conceptual model for spacecraft and astronautical communities.
